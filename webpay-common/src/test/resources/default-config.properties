# Replace these credentials with your own by creating a copy of this file and name it
# user-config.properties.
# Alternatively, only copy and adjust the default_credentials.json file that is generated by these credentials after 
# the junit tests have been run (specifically TestCreateDefaultCredentials).
# Your SECRET credentials will then reside in user_credentials.json which should never be disclosed.

# NOTE!! NEVER CHANGE THIS FILE TO AVOID REAL CREDENTIALS FROM ENTERING A JAR OR GIT-REPOSITORY.
# Below are public test credentials available in the official documentation.
